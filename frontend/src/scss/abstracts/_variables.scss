  Each flex item has a flex-basis which is sort of like its initial size. Then from there, any remaining free space is distributed proportionally (based
  on flex-grow) among the items. With auto, that basis is the contents size (or defined size with width, etc.). As a result, items with bigger text within
  are being given more space overall in your example.

  If you want your elements to be completely even, you can set flex-basis: 0. This will set the flex basis to 0 and then any remaining space (which will be
  all space since all basises are 0) will be proportionally distributed based on flex-grow.
