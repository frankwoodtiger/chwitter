Pretty good article about organization of Sass project: https://itnext.io/structuring-your-sass-projects-c8d41fa55ed4
If we use bootstrap sass, instead of bootstrap css, then this is the correct way to load bootstrap instead of 'import bootstrap;'' in entry js

For underscore prefix, if you have _foo.scss, then all of these imports have identical results as long as you don't have any ambiguous filenames
@import "foo";
@import "foo.scss";
@import "_foo";
@import "_foo.scss";

@import "~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
@import "abstracts/variables";
@import "base/reset";
@import "components/header";
@import "components/footer";
@import "components/table";
@import "pages/base";
@import "pages/home";
@import "pages/registerForm";
@import "pages/admin";
