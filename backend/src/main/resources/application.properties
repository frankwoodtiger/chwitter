# If you are talking to an in memory db, by default, it looks at the entities and creates the database and the tables.
# However, if you connect to a mysql database, Spring Boot knows that its a permanent database. By default, it expects
# you to set up the database, set up the tables and it uses the connection that you established.
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop
# Spring Boot chooses a default value for you based on whether it thinks your database is embedded (default: create-drop) or not (default: none).
# An embedded database is detected by looking at the Connection type: hsqldb, h2 and derby are embedded, the rest are not.
# Be careful when switching from in-memory to a ¡§real¡¨ database that you don¡¦t make assumptions about the existence of
# the tables and data in the new platform. You either have to set ddl-auto explicitly, or use one of the other mechanisms
# to initialize the database.
# none: No change is made to the database structure.
# update: Hibernate changes the database according to the given entity structures but it does not remove old columns/contraints.
# create: Creates the database every time but does not drop it on close.
# create-drop: Creates the database and drops it when SessionFactory closes. Mainly used for development

# Spring JDBC has a DataSource initializer feature. Spring Boot enables it by default and loads SQL from the standard
# locations schema.sql and data.sql (in the root of the classpath). In addition Spring Boot will load a file
# schema-${platform}.sql where platform is the value of spring.datasource.platform, e.g. you might choose to set it to
# the vendor name of the database (hsqldb, h2, oracle, mysql, postgresql etc.). Spring Boot enables the failfast feature
# of the Spring JDBC initializer by default, so if the scripts cause exceptions the application will fail to start.
